    "# Exercise Sheet 3: Collaborative Filtering with Steam Games\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will build a collaborative filtering recommender system using data we gather from Steam. We will use your friends list to get information about owned games for each ID, and the time each game was played.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, collaborative filtering is based on some sort of rating to determine the similarity between users. However, for games, the enjoyment and a rating do not always match. Additionally, only about 10% of players actually rate the games they play, which would make for a very incomplete dataset. Therefore, the playtime will be used instead of a rating system. This has the added benefit that playtime is usually the most authentic metric of enjoyment, as players are very unlikely to spend much time on a game they don't enjoy."

    "\n",
    "**1.** Your first task is to **gather the data** needed to create the recommender system. **Create a data structure** that holds the needed information for each player and game. To do this, **open the URL** with the given `request()` function, **read** the json response and retrieve your games library and playtime. Then **save** the games into a dictionary with `key=name` and `values=playtime`. **Do not add** games with 0 playtime to this dictionary.\n",

    "**Notes:** \n",
    "- You have three different options to solve this exercise. You can either:\n",
    "    - Use your own Steam profile (strongly recommended)\n",
    "    - Use the provided default Steam account (in case you do not own a Steam profile)\n",
    "    - Use the provided .json file (in case you do not have a Steam profile and the default Steam account becomes overcrowded)\n",
    "- your choice will not affect your grade in any way\n",
    "- You cannot obtain a list from your profile with the Steam API unless your profile is set to public. \n",
    "- Upon executing the code below, you will notice that a lot of profiles \"`couldnt decode`\". These are private or deleted profiles and it is totally fine to get this message.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "- In case you wish to use your own Steam profile, but are afraid to share your personal [key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) [1] and id, please be informed that you can delete them **after** solving the tasks and before submitting your solutions. The outputs will be saved in the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "- To obtain the games a user owns, use this: `games = data['response']['games']`. This returns a list of games, including the playtime (in minutes) which can be retrieved like this: `playtime = game['playtime_forever']`, where game refers to an item from the list of games. "

    "## Task 3.2: Association rule mining\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start with the \"real\" recommender system, let us take a look at a more general form of recommending items using association rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of association rule mining is rather simple: Looking at an itemset, one tries to find dependencies between items that could \"belong together\". A common example would be buying food at the store: If, for example, meat and salt are bought together often, but meat without salt not that often, it is assumed that there is a connection between those two. For games, if it was found that most of the users who own the demo version of a game also own the full version of that game, it would be a reasonable assumption that these users liked the demo and therefore bought the full version.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first cover the mathematical basis for association rules. The most important metrics used are **support**,  **confidence** and **lift**. The first is defined as the amount of times an item occurs in the itemset divided by the total number of items in the set; the second is defined as the support of a list of items [x,y,...] divided by the support of x. Lift is a measure describing the correlation between items. Written down mathematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$supp(x)= \\frac{len(x)}{len(n)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$conf(x=>y) = \\frac{supp(x,y)}{supp(x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$lift(x=>y) = \\frac{P(x \\cap y)}{P(x) * P(y)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that support refers to an item or a list of items, while confidence refers to a rule. Also note that a lift of 1 means that x and y occur independently of each other, while a lift greater 1 means a positive correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** Your task here is to first **convert** the dictionary you created into a list of lists as this is the input required for the algorithm to work. Then, **print out** the most frequent items using the `min_support` attribute. Finally, **print out** the association rules and **play around with the threshold value** to get a reasonable amount of rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Play around with the threshold values until you get a reasonable amount (4-30) rows as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** **Discuss your results** and try to answer the following questions: \n",
    "- What kind of recommendations can be made?\n",
    "- What does a confidence of 1.0 mean and is it meaningful for recommending games? \n",
    "- Can you spot a correlation between the games with the highest support and the rules with the highest confidence? How does this affect the lift?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** There is a high chance that games such as \"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\" appear very often, you should at least have two different games in the antecedents and consequents column to make meaningful conclusions."

    "2. After analysing both recommendations techniques, I prefer collaborative filtering as a better and more accurate recommendation system. The association rule oftens suggests the combination of games that I already have and often the games that are the most popular ones are the ones that are free to play. They are not necessarily the best recommendation. In the collaborative filtering, the games are based on the playtime of friends and are games that I don't already have, therefore the result is a more intelligent recommendation.\n",
